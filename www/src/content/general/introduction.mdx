# Introduction

Hello there, I'm [Jake](https://jakeisonline.com) and this is my little playground. It's a collection of components, templates, experiments, and other bits and bobs.

As much as possible I've tried to make everything here shared and re-usable. All the components, for example, can be copied and pasted or simply installed via the shadcn CLI.
