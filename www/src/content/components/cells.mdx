| Key                   | Action                                                                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <kbd>ArrowRight</kbd> | Moves focus to the next cell if caret is at the end of the current cell's input       |
| <kbd>ArrowLeft</kbd>  | Moves focus to the previous cell if caret is at the start of the current cell's input |
| <kbd>ArrowUp</kbd>    | Moves focus to the cell directly above the current cell, if it exists                 |
| <kbd>ArrowDown</kbd>  | Moves focus to the cell directly below the current cell, if it exists                 |

#### Modifiers

The following modifiers - keys you hold while pressing other keys - can be used to modify the behavior of the keyboard interactions documented above.

| Key                                | Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>                    | When <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> (or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> on Mac) is held, and any <kbd>Arrow</kbd> key is then pressed, the focus will change to the furthest cell in the direction of the arrow key.                                                                                                    |
| <kbd>Shift</kbd>                   | When <kbd>Shift</kbd> is held, and any <kbd>Arrow</kbd> key is then pressed, a selection box will be drawn starting from the currently focused cell, which can be further increased or decreased using the <kbd>Arrow</kbd> keys. The focus will not change.                            |
| <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> | When <kbd>Shift</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> (or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> on Mac) are held, and any <kbd>Arrow</kbd> key is then pressed, a selection box will be drawn starting from the currently focused field, and then the furthest field in the direction of the <kbd>Arrow</kbd> key pressed. |
