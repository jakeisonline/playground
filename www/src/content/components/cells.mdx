# Cells

The Cells component is a complex user interface element that allows a user to select and edit values across spreadsheet-like cells.

<ExampleComponent name={frontmatter.component} client:load />

## Accessibility

Adheres to the [Grid WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/grid/).

### Keyboard interactions

| Key                                      | Action                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <kbd>ArrowRight</kbd>                    | Moves selection to the next cell in the current row            |
| <kbd>ArrowLeft</kbd>                     | Moves selection to the previous cell in the current row        |
| <kbd>ArrowUp</kbd>                       | Moves selection to the cell directly above the current cell    |
| <kbd>ArrowDown</kbd>                     | Moves selection to the cell directly below the current cell    |
| <kbd>Backspace</kbd> / <kbd>Delete</kbd> | Deletes the value of the currently selected cell's input field |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd>                         | Focuses the currently focused cell's input field               |
| <kbd>Escape</kbd>                        | Escapes from currently focused cell's input field              |

#### Modifiers

The following modifiers - keys you hold while pressing other keys - can be used to modify the behavior of the documented keyboard interactions.

| Key                                | Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>                    | When <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> (or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> on Mac) is held, and any <kbd>Arrow</kbd> key is then pressed or <kbd>MouseDown</kbd> event occurs, the focus will change to the furthest cell in the direction of the arrow key.                                                                                                                       |
| <kbd>Shift</kbd>                   | When <kbd>Shift</kbd> is held, and any <kbd>Arrow</kbd> key is then pressed or <kbd>MouseDown</kbd> event occurs, a selection box will be drawn starting from the currently focused cell, which can be further increased or decreased using the <kbd>Arrow</kbd> keys, or further <kbd>MouseDown</kbd> events occur. The focus will not change. |
| <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> | When <kbd>Shift</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> (or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> on Mac) are held, and any <kbd>Arrow</kbd> key is then pressed, a selection box will be drawn starting from the currently focused field, and then the furthest field in the direction of the <kbd>Arrow</kbd> key pressed. The focus will not change.                              |
