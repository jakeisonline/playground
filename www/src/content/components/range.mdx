# Range

The Range component is a user interface element that allows users to easily set a minimum and maximum value (a range), using interactive sliders.

<ExampleComponent name={frontmatter.component} client:load />

## Usage

```jsx
import {
  StepperField,
  StepperFieldButton,
  StepperFieldInput,
  StepperFieldLabel,
} from "@/components/stepper-field"
```

```jsx
<StepperField start={0}>
  <StepperFieldLabel htmlFor="stepper">Quantity</StepperFieldLabel>
  <StepperFieldButton direction="down">-</StepperFieldButton>
  <StepperFieldInput id="stepper" />
  <StepperFieldButton direction="up">+</StepperFieldButton>
</StepperField>
```

## Accessibility

Adheres to the [Slider (multi-thumb) WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/slider-multithumb/).

Each `<RangeGrabber>` should have an aria-label prop, describing what that grabber represents. For example, if you have a price range, you might have a low price grabber with an `aria-label="Low price"` and a high price grabber with an `aria-label="High price"`.
