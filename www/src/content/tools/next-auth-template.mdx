## Features

- Custom sign in and sign up pages as a starting point for your own
- Database-backed sessions all managed for you thanks to [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/) and [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/)
- Basic account creation and set up for first time users
- Google Sign-in ready for config, easily add [other providers Auth.js has to offer](https://authjs.dev/reference/core/providers)
- Optional [Magic Links](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/authentication/email) via [Resend](https://resend.com/emails) ready for config, or [any other email provider Auth.js can support](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/authentication/email#providers)
- Protected paths via middleware, easily customisable to your needs

> This template uses major dependencies that are not yet stable. It is not recommended for production use until `next-auth` and `drizzle-orm` are stable

## Getting Started

There is some initial setup required to get this template up and running. It won't take long.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed
- A PostgreSQL database. This template uses [Neon](https://neon.tech/), but there are other options.

### Installation

Use the handy CLI tool to quickly start building a new Next.js application, with auth already set up.

```bash
pnpm dlx next-auth-template
# or
npx next-auth-template
# or
bunx --bun next-auth-template
```

You will be asked to select a template:

```bash
? Select a template › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
❯   One-to-one
    One-to-many
```

You will also be asked to provide a project name. This is also used as the directory name. You can leave it as default (.) to have the project initialized into the current directory. Must be a single word, no special characters.

```bash
? Enter the name of your project › .
```

If everything goes well, you will see a message of confirmation.

```bash
✔ Template copied successfully to /path/to/project
```

#### Non-interactive

You can also use the CLI non-interactively; provide arguments and options to the CLI to skip the prompts.

```bash
Usage: next-auth-template [options] [template]

Create a new Next.js application with auth already set up

Arguments:
  template                   name of the template to initialize -- optional (choices: "one-to-one", "one-to-many")

Options:
  -v, --version              show version of cli
  -p, --project-name <name>  name of the project to initialize, also used as the directory name
  -o, --overwrite            overwrite existing files in the directory (project name) without prompting
  -h, --help                 display help for command
```

#### Enabling Magic Links

Magic links are a great way to sign in users without them needing to have any social media accounts. Magic links are not enabled by default, due to requiring an email provider and live domain and DNS record setup. To enable magic links, follow these steps:

1. Follow the [Auth.js documentation](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/providers/resend#configuration) up to and including setting the `AUTH_RESEND_KEY` environment variable.
2. Be sure to set `MAGIC_LINK_EMAIL_FROM` to the email address you want to send magic links from.

That's it! Note domain validation with Resend will be required for magic links to work, and could take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours to validate.

## Making changes

While this template is designed to be as simple as possible, with the intention of you enhancing it further, there are a few changes you might want to make.

### Change PostgreSQL host

This template expects a PostgreSQL database, and uses Drizzle ORM to interface with it. Out of the box, Drizzle is configured to use Neon, but you can change this to any other PostgreSQL host.

1. In [`db/db.ts`](src/db/db.ts), change the `sql` variable to point to your PostgreSQL host of choice, so long as Drizzle has an adapter for it.

See [Drizzle ORM's documentation](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started-postgresql) for more information.

### Add other Auth.js providers

This template uses Google Sign-in, but you can add other providers Auth.js supports.

1. Browse the available providers in [Auth.js's documentation](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/authentication/oauth)
2. Add the required environment variables for your new provider to `.env`
3. In [`src/lib/auth.ts`](src/lib/auth.ts), add the provider to the `providers` array (and be sure to import it!)
4. On your sign in and sign up pages, add `<SocialSignInButton provider="new_provider" />` component where `new_provider` is the name of the provider you added

### Change Email Provider

By default, this template uses [Resend](https://resend.com/emails) to send magic links. You can change this to any other email provider that Auth.js supports.

See [Auth.js's documentation](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/authentication/email#signin-5) for more information on which email providers Auth.js supports. You'll need to update [`lib/auth.ts`](src/lib/auth.ts) and [`actions/magic-auth.ts`](src/actions/magic-auth.ts) to support the new provider.

## Environment Variables

This template relies on environment variables to work. You can use the [`.env.example`](.env.example) file as a starting guide; rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values.

| Variable Name        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| `RESEND_KEY`         | The API key for [Resend](https://resend.com/). Required for magic links. If not set, disables magic link auth. [See Auth.js docs for Resend set up](https://authjs.dev/guides/configuring-resend). |
| `AUTH_SECRET`        | A secret used to sign cookies and to sign and verify JSON Web Tokens. [See Auth.js docs on how to generate](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/deployment#auth_secret). Required in production.    |
| `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID`     | The Client ID for your Google OAuth app. Required for social sign in. [See Auth.js docs for set up](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/providers/google#setup).                                    |
